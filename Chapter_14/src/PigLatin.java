/*14.6 (Project: Limericks) A limerick is a humorous five-line verse in which the first and second lines
rhyme with the fifth, and the third line rhymes with the fourth. Using techniques similar to those developed
in Exercise 14.5, write a Java application that produces random limericks. Polishing this application
to produce good limericks is a challenging problem, but the result will be worth the effort!*/
