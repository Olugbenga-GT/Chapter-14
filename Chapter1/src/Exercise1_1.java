1.7. In Java programs, the source code are compiled with "Javac" command and this
     causes the code to compile line after line and are in turn converted to bytecode
      with a ".class" extension. The compiled bytecode is then converted by the JVM into
      the local machine's machine language which then makes the bytecode executable for the machine.

 1.8  Question: One of the worldâ€™s most common objects is a wrist watch. Discuss how each of the
      following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: object, attributes, behaviors
      , class, inheritance (consider, for example, an alarm clock), modeling, messages, encapsulation,
      interface and information hiding.

      a. Class: The class serves as a template from which the watch is made from; and many other
         watches can be made from this same class.
         Object: Since the watch is made from the class (Watch template), the watch is said to be an
         object of the class.
         Attributes: are observable characteristics of the watch that ca as well be manipulated.
         Inheritance: The watches made from the class template all have attributes that are present in
         the class, this is known as inheritance. The watches also have their special characteristics
          that are peculiar to them,
          Encapsulation: the operations(method) of each wristwatch is covered by the class and not made accessible
          to other watches
          Interface: this a collection of operations (method) the watch can perform.
          information Hiding: The watches at times allow other watch to execute their operations but then
          does not show them the working principle and details of such operations.
